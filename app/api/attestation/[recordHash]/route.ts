/**
 * Read-only, unauthenticated lookup of an attestation by record hash. A
 * distinct Route Handler (rather than folded into the card page's Server
 * Component) because this is meant to be callable by things that aren't
 * this app's own pages — client-side polling, or henbridge-verifier later —
 * per README.md > Repository Structure.
 *
 * --- Rate limiting (issue-03) ---
 * The *primary* defense against enumerating record hashes is the
 * commitment scheme itself: record_hash is now HMAC-keyed by a per-patient
 * 256-bit secret (lib/attestation/recordHash.ts), so brute-forcing a valid
 * hash is computationally infeasible regardless of request rate. The
 * per-instance limiter below is defense-in-depth on top of that, not the
 * primary control — a fully distributed, atomicity-correct rate limiter is
 * separately tracked in issues/issue-07-distributed-rate-limiting.md
 * (which explicitly scopes this route out of its own work); duplicating
 * that effort here would be out of scope for this issue.
 *
 * Keyed by IP only: there's no user/email identity on this route, and
 * keying by the guessed hash itself would let an attacker evade the limit
 * trivially by varying the hash every request. recordFailure is called on
 * every request (not just misses) — a single lucky guess must not reset an
 * attacker's counter the way a correct password does on sign-in.
