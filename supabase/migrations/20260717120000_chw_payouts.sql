-- chw_payouts: off-chain mirror of on-chain USDC-on-Stellar CHW payout events (M2)
--
-- On-chain vs off-chain relationship
-- -----------------------------------
-- The Stellar ledger (via henbridge-contracts) is the source of truth for whether
-- a CHW was actually paid: it holds the USDC transfer itself. This table does
-- NOT replace that. It is a queryable, RLS-protected mirror, populated by a
-- listener process that observes attestation + payout events on-chain and
-- writes/updates rows here so a CHW can see their own earnings without
-- running a Stellar block explorer query themselves.
--
-- Each row represents one verification event (one attested record_hash) and
-- its payout lifecycle: pending (attested, payout not yet observed on-chain)
-- -> paid (payout_tx_hash observed on-chain for this record_hash).
--
-- This mirrors the documentation style of the profiles table migration:
-- schema + RLS + comments explaining intent, landed as its own additive
-- migration. No changes to profiles or any patient-facing table/flow.
