comment on table public.reattestation_requests is
  'Patient-raised queue of "profile changed, please re-verify" requests. Populated by the patient themselves (own row only); consumed/updated by a CHW-facing tool (out of scope here) or by the profile page itself marking a request completed once a matching attestation is observed on-chain.';

create index reattestation_requests_user_id_idx on public.reattestation_requests (user_id);

-- At most one pending request per (user, hash) — makes the "Request
-- re-verification" button idempotent without extra app-side bookkeeping.
create unique index reattestation_requests_pending_unique
  on public.reattestation_requests (user_id, record_hash)
  where status = 'pending';

-- No update/delete policy for authenticated: marking a request

-- migrations directory.
